Objectivity, detaches you from it. Experience, from reflection. Connection, from empathy. Empathy, from conscious effort to understand. Understanding, requires thought, patience and time.\n\nNow that the pretentious part is done with, we can begin. (*they say writing is therapeutic, so here I am trying to keep my sanity for a little while longer*)\n\nLet's talk.\n\nSince this is a photography website or my photography portfolio or what have you. We'll talk about how I express myself through my images.\n\n(*if you care that is, continue to read*).\n\nYou'll see that the black and white ones are dark. I mean, yes, it's black and white. But it's dark. Like this one for example:\n\nAnd for colour, I tend to go for pastel or muted in the tones. Like these examples (the middle one being my favourite for both obvious and less obvious reasons):\n\nThere is a certain kind of balance required I feel. And what I think doesn't really matter. See, it's okay to be objective. And for the most part, it is desirable. What I have found best is to follow your gut or instinct or that little voice in your head. Okay, maybe not that little voice in your head.\n\nIn addition to that, as the person taking the photo, or the person writing, or experiencing a certain situation. This idiom comes to mind, \"*(right) under someone's (very) nose*\". The closer we are to something, it can be an objective even. The less we see. Myopic is a good analogy for it. So we have to take a step back right?\n\n> Now this is the hard part. \n\nI have made countless mistakes, most I can recover from. And some, I couldn't. And some, I just don't know. Those \"*some mistakes\" *are unfortunately really big ones, which they usually are. The kind that sticks with you for life, in good ways and bad, shapes you into a different kind of being or specifically person (*I'm just being species neutral here).*\n\n> Okay wait, what's the hard part? \n\nOps, got lost in my thoughts there. The hard part is actually doing it. Sounds obvious right? And half of it is actually being aware enough to catch yourself before it's too late. \n\n> How do we make it easier? \n\nHaving good friends. Now, this is subjective. But in my opinion, friends should be people who can take a step back from whatever biases (*I mean there will always be a bias*), and judge what you did. They know you well enough and aren't afraid of saying harsh things to you. I know that friends should always get your back right? Well, not always. Friends should always tell you if you're doing something wrong, or stupid and especially not leave you to your own devices when your gut can't be trusted.\n\nIt's the same reason why even Magnum photographers have editors to pick images for them. They are too close to it. It's also another reason why I tend to develop film late, or sit on it for a long period of time. (*although I should be better with developing it earlier*) I come to it with no memory or much memory of what has transpired during that shot. You can't really do that with life though, with relationships for example.\n\nWhich is why you need to have that support structure. Everyone does. Even me. There are good ones and bad ones. If you're of sane mind at this time, there's no better time than now to think about it. Constant reflection is key to self-improvement. Even if you fail again. Even if you repeat again. Reflect always.\n\nIf you don't have that support structure. Then, there's really not much *you alone* can do about it. You can try to rationalise your way out of it. Or distract yourself. But those are band-aid solutions. It has to go deeper. And few can do that alone. Try seek help. Ask for opinions. Then, just ride it out I suppose. I can't really offer any insight here. To each his own. Or her own.\n\nWhich brings us back to expression. In other words, the colour of communication. If you got that part down right, most of your problems are gone. \n\nThe rest is really up to the interpretation of the recipient. And then, you just have to accept it. \n\n> P.S: No more image posts on the site for now I think. But we'll see soon enough.

A collection of experiences that I have had, so in that way, it is a journal of my travels or of how I see things in my day to day. \n\nOr rather what I deem as *pleasing* to my eye, or interesting to say the least.","src/content/muses/2017-11-24-revista-explained.mdx","128cb2029e654f16","marathon-man",{"id":185,"data":187,"body":193,"filePath":194,"digest":195,"deferredRender":23},{"title":188,"tags":189,"author":16,"description":190,"pubDate":191,"updatedDate":192},"Marathon Man",[9],"So yes, I ran a marathon yesterday.",["Date","2017-12-04T17:00:43.000Z"],["Date","2019-09-15T10:41:01.000Z"],"Copyright claim on that title.\n\nSo yes, I ran a marathon yesterday.\n\nIt still feels surreal that I actually have done it. There's that feeling euphoria of having completed it. But when all's settled. All of life's miseries came rushing back in spades. I did tear up at one point during the race. And my thoughts in the beginning of the race was filled by things *besides* the race. Not a good way to start. But, the first half was not too bad.\n\nI am now suffering like an old man. I can barely walk or stand up or sit down or go down the stairs. Everything's a pain. But I am eating a lot now, which is a good thing. I have to gain back all the lost muscle. So yes, I might try the gym this time. I'll do a 5x5 programme. Functional strength.\n\nit's a time for recovery now (*in the literal sense*). Getting back into physical shape, training and running a marathon does wondrous damage to your body.\n\nSo why a marathon? To those who know me to some capacity. They'll say I don't like running long distances, or that I find it boring. Which is true. So why? Why suffer for 42.195km, doing something I don't like, pay money for it, then get pain and suffering afterwards? Why do anything at all I guess. Everyone has their reasons for doing anything that they set out to do. Nothing's really right or wrong. \n\nI guess it's the same reason why anyone else does it I suppose. For me personally, those reasons above are exactly why. I wanted to prove it to myself that I could do something as hard as that and pull through. And to do it,  just for the sake of it (*I can be a bit of a masochist sometimes*). And I want to see if I really can follow through with my mantra of \"*finishing what I started*\". \n\nSo I did it.

And the next year will be for the most part; highly, highly uncertain (*but before that I have to survive the remaining of this year first*). I simply do not have any sort of an inkling as to what will happen or how things will turn out. But I guess in that respect it is going to be exciting. Or nerve-wracking. Whichever way you want to look at it. I have some plans laid out for those who are not privy to this information prior to this. Not new certainly, but are starting to come to light, and some closer to fruition. But perhaps, even that is too soon to say:\n\n1. A photography project (long form portrait series, hope that museum replies to me soon they replied, \"Yes.\" hehe)\n2. Pseudo-business plans (anthropologically-focused block-chain integrated micro-financing project and a collaboration with [Hakim](https://unusualfelines.com/) and [Matt](https://www.instagram.com/matthewc.may/))\n3. Overseas Entrepreneurship Programme (if I do get it)\n4. Internships in Europe (currently sourcing in Sweden, if I do get one, maybe [Pascal](http://www.pascalmaurice.de/) can help me with that as well in Germany)\n\nSo, that's about it I think. We all have our own fair share of troubles but we always have to move forward. Don't get me wrong, it gets really hard sometimes. I do not need to go into details about how hard things can get.\n\nI really do like this Swedish quote I found mid of last year (more than 1.5 years ago):\n\n*Det blir som det blir.*\n\nIt literally means \"*it will be like it will be*\". Sounds a bit negative but it is very Stoic in its nature. The English interpretation is, \"*We must take things as we find them*\". Being that, we make plans not to make circumstances fit those plans, but make plans to fit those circumstances as aptly put George S. Patton in *War as I knew It* (1947).\n\nKeep busy, be productive. Idle hands are the devil's workshop (*speaking of which, I now have 8 rolls of Kodak Tri-X, 5 rolls of Cinestill 800T, and an incoming 5 rolls of Kodak Portra 160, 5 rolls of Cinestill BwXX and 5 more rolls of Cinestill 800T. Mmmm. So goood*).\n\nThat is not to say to keep busy with things that will make you regret doing the next day just because you decided to do it for the sake of doing it, to fit in or whatever lame excuse you are using to justify yourself. The moment you have to bend yourself to justify your actions, take a step back, then two, then turn around, and walk home buddy. Just go on home.\n\nJust putting it out there.

And it makes sense, it talks about undying devotion, well, until you're actually dead. It's a romance film, so having a romantic title fits the bill, romantic gestures. Idealism. But, it can be for yourself too. When you take away everything from a person, I believe what's left is the person's belief (*hah pun*). His/her (*I don't actually have to do this, in English, a general he/his/man is gender neutral, if I'm not mistaken*, *but you don't want SJWs coming in here*) principles. Or his/her word.\n\nOftentimes, we tend to seek extrinsic sources of motivation, something to devote ourselves to, something to give us purpose. But maybe, it should be inward instead. Don't get me wrong. Having to live for something greater than yourself is, well, amazing. But not everyone can find that. I thought I did. Maybe, I still do. But yeah, now I don't know. Hence, today we talk about intrinsic motivation, devotion, belief ladida.\n\nWhy does it have to be internal? It's hard, it's vague, it's slow. \"*Find your inner strength*\", for example, is a very vague expression. What do you even look for? Yet, those age old masters of wisdom expound this till their breath went stale.\n\nThe best analogy I can come with up with is the base load.\n\nIn electrical utility companies, they determine demand of electricity through the base load, intermediate, and peak load. Base load is something they absolutely have to be able to produce electricity at. And this is the argument against clean energy for example, since it's volatile. That's why battery technology is so important for the development of clean energy. But I digress.\n\nInternal motivations for example, is to target the base load. You can always rely on it. Because you can always rely on yourself. Unless you're mentally unstable or paraplegic. Or bipolar. But you get the point. Extrinsic motivations, are to target the peak loads, sudden bursts of energy that you can use to target those times whereby demand is spiking. Things like discipline and your principle are things that should never be able to be eroded away or changed willy-nilly. They are stable.\n\nSo, why not devote yourself to yourself. To be a better version of yourself, whatever that means to you.\n\nForever and a day.","src/content/muses/2017-12-23-forever-and-a-day.mdx","551569ddef7750e4","hiatus",{"id":229,"data":231,"body":237,"filePath":238,"digest":239,"deferredRender":23},{"title":232,"tags":233,"author":16,"description":234,"pubDate":235,"updatedDate":236},"Hiatus",[9],"It's a click-bait-y title but it's not that all inaccurate.

I have talked to the photography-in-charge of the county museum, and have seen the darkroom. It has an old school layout as pointed out by my photography teacher. It has a bunch (*a lot*) of photographic paper, some chemicals for printing but lacking on the film development front. Of which, I still have not worked out the logistics. Besides that, I was offered to teach courses there. But thinking of it now, I cannot really teach without the necessary materials to do so. So, there is that. Also, a small exhibition for myself (*or the class?*), which is amazing (*either way*).\n\nMore people have accepted to be my subjects for the project. I have also gotten a new 50mm lens (*Carl Zeiss Planar*) for it. Has some dust specks within the lens elements but it should not be too much of a problem, I hope. Some are really interested in the project, and they have put quite a bit of thought into how they want themselves to be presented, which is again, amazing. Although, the conception of the idea of the project itself evolved over time. Which is fine, and is something to be seen as a good thing I feel. To a point.\n\nI went to Poland; Kraków and Warsaw. Met an old friend. Did not want to return. It was not something I can really tell tales with. But it is something significant nonetheless. The little things, the indescribables.

The assignments are not challenging by any means. And at this point, I feel that I did not really learn anything new. Ended up being a didactic motherfucker instead.

I suppose it is more of the internal processes we go through. It is always good to think about the things that you are doing, and re-think them again and again. Soon, the decisions you have made before start to make less sense. The motivations change. You perhaps second guess yourself. Make more mistakes. Feelings dissipate. Confusion. Coldness.\n\nIt is fine. All is well.\n\nWe all have to go through our own versions of a thought process. It is about the journey, not the end. At least, as an academic exercise.

At this point, I would say that I have reached equilibrium during the time that I have spent here. Consequently, the disquiet, and the need for isolation becomes more apparent.\n\nThere are some changes, not to say the least, regarding my emotional and mental state. However physically I have, for the better at least. School for the most part remains as unchallenging as it always has been. More and more I feel that it is failing to serve its purpose, especially business schools. We have way too many of those, and they should be bulldozed.\n\nIt has reached a point whereby you would even say it has become dull. Although, I find it interesting that my usual life motto being that discipline is key to life, and that having too much freedom has the opposite effect of trapping you within your many fleeting desires, drawing parallels here. School is exactly that. When everything is a choice for the sake of being a choice. Added to the fact that level of difficulty really is something to brush off. And most importantly, there is no consequence.\n\nSure, failure should be accepted but to a point. When there is no consequence to failing, and the societal acceptance of which leads me to believe that it creates uninspiring, ill-disciplined, weak-willed, social-confirming *individuals*. Strong words. And I can eat them later on (comment if you want). At the same time, it really does depends on the individual himself doesn't it? Still, a lot can be said about the environment required to nurture said individual.\n\nDuring the budding years, people learn laterally, parents have less of an impact on their children than you might think, especially in terms of how they learn. The question of whether it is required to change the status quo or not depends on whether the society wants to facilitate that change which depends if it is necessary to their eyes. Need meets want.\n\nI digress.\n\nPhotography wise, still nothing for now. But I did receive my SX-70, and have taken a few shots on it, two failures so far but that is just how it is with analogue. The rest turned out pretty good. Definitely a conversation starter, perhaps also a decent-ish parting gift for having their portraits taken. Possibilities are endless.\n\nWell, I guess I have taken more on my phone than anything else I suppose (*the best camera is the one you have with you at that time that you need to take a photo*). Which leads me to a point about getting a really good compact camera. Now you see a pattern here. As much as I would like to bring my Leica around, the place is not dynamic enough. It is not alive as I would like it to be. Everything is same-y. Then again, if I constantly have to justify my actions (*don't get me wrong, everyone should)*, nothing gets done.\n\nSo a little *\"folj med strömmen\"* should be good.\n\nThen again, that is probably me with G-A-S.\n\nWith a serious case of ennui.","src/content/muses/2018-05-01-the-fourth.mdx","423bedeb7e9dd200","the-fifth",{"id":325,"data":327,"body":336,"filePath":337,"digest":338,"deferredRender":23},{"title":328,"tags":329,"author":16,"description":330,"image":331,"pubDate":334,"updatedDate":335},"The Fifth",[9],"No, not in reference to a particular amendment in the American constitution.",{"src":332,"alt":333,"positionx":261,"positiony":277},"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/tenhult_lake.jpg","fifth_1",["Date","2018-06-01T10:10:36.000Z"],["Date","2020-04-11T08:46:40.000Z"],"No, not in reference to a particular amendment in the American constitution.\n\nWhen the days start to amalgamate, you begin to think about whether the days you have lived were *lived* or were they just remnants of a past dream experienced by another version of you in a different space, and in a different time.\n\nThere is a story by a Chinese philosopher, Chuang-Tzu, called The Butterfly Dream (it serves as an allegory for the point that I was making, if there was any point at all, as usual):\n\n\"Once upon a time, I, Chuang-Tzu, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chuang-Tzu. Soon I awakened, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.\"\n\nThis talks about the distinction between illusion and reality, that we can never be sure we are actually awake. We think we might have but we really might have not been. I suppose, when one stops to think about why we do the things that we do, how we live day in and day out, how we do things for the sake of doing them, or to conform - it is not surprising that differentiating the two can be difficult.\n\nThat is not to say currently we do not know whether the dreams that we dream about are real or not, or whether that the reality that we live in is real or not. This is more to talk about the things that we do day to day. At least, in my own interpretation or usage of this allegory, when one cannot differentiate one thing from the other.\n\nBut, I digress.\n\nIt has inevitably come to an end. Perhaps earlier than was hoped to be however any decision to prolong it would be unsound when the reciprocity is unmet. The consequence of which has resulted in my wasting away. I have thought about this perennially, even if I came to the conclusion that it would be a fool's errand, the hope that is there is not lost even when there is none.","src/content/muses/2018-06-01-the-fifth.mdx","08db9fcea8b94f5b","the-sixth",{"id":339,"data":341,"body":351,"filePath":352,"digest":353,"deferredRender":23},{"title":342,"tags":343,"author":16,"description":344,"image":345,"pubDate":349,"updatedDate":350},"The Sixth",[9],"We have reached half of the year today.

At the same time, I believe that people, you and I, as individuals (that's an oxymoron-ic idea in the same sentence) exist infinitely in a finite spectrum of being. Who is to say this person that you are in the past, now and would be in the future is you or is not you? What is the \"core\" version of you? Is anything really that is set in stone? To think you know something or someone, is the surest way to blind yourself from learning about them, or yourself.\n\nBut I digress. As always.\n\nThings are falling into place like jigsaw (yes, Radiohead reference). Almost every aspect of my life is progressing. You can say (so far) things are taking a turn for me. In retrospection, should I talk to \"me\" from 6 months ago or even 10 months ago, I would be glad to say that a lot has changed, for the better (subjective). Of course, there would always be lapses. But they are few and far in between now, and when they do happen, they are not as intense as they used to be.\n\nPost-hoc rationalisation working its charm. It takes time, certainly. We tend to think we are rational people, that after a certain age, we are adults. See. Being an adult is a state of mind. Not about your age, not about what you do, the people you associate with or the social status that you are born with and any other superficial or material factors.\n\nIt is about the thought process, the principles you hold fast, the way you relate to other people, to societal cues and norms. Simply put, to really be able to think for yourself without getting too affected by the environment. Sure, we will get affected either way. But as adults (I would say) you choose what you take in or not. Like the semi-permeable membrane of the cell. Unless you're a plant, then you have the cell wall, nothing gets in. I think. (correct me if I'm wrong, biologists)\n\nThe portrait series is trudging along nicely. A whole slew of individuals are lined up to get shot *hah*. Someone asked to buy some prints of my work, which I have not gotten to yet because the funds are non-existent. But that might change this coming week (I guess not, maybe next week). Exciting stuff is going to happen, exciting because I make it so. When you water the plant regularly, tend to the salinity and alkaline/acidity levels of the soil, the nutrients and the sunlight it requires. When it blooms, it is hard work paid off right? The final flourish. The great pay off.\n\nIt all boils down (me and my soup analogies) to discipline. Which is will, consistency and the presence of mind to do what needs to be done, regardless of the environmental, physical and psychological ailments that might be affecting you.\n\n> “I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo. \n>\n> \"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.

Do we change as people or do the actions themselves change? Would the actions represent us as a individuals capable of conscious thought and effort, or is it separate? Perhaps one way to look at it is the perennial conversation about separating who the artist is as a person and the art that is created. Action and person is separated. In a way.\n\nWhy I said whether I have iterated upon myself or whether I have evolved pertains to this. Evolution means that I am entirely different being. Whereas iteration means that I have created a new shell around this core being that is myself. I have dictated some changes towards the actions or reactions that I do on a daily basis. Perhaps, a lot of the things that I do has changed, this includes the kind of art that I indulge in and occasionally create but to say that I have changed might be an egregious error on my part.\n\nI have talked about how we exist within a spectrum of being and this adds on to that idea that we are never really changing but just switching between the multitude of selves, just multifaceted people with evolving actions and habits that we exert upon the world. The intentions, the thought process, the process in itself might not be any different. That is not to say evolution is not possible but it is highly unusual, as far as I can tell.\n\nChange does not just happen, and change is uncomfortable. It takes time. Which is why educating children about ideas and concepts would be a lot easier than say, an adult. But at the same time, it is not about the age (it is the common denominator) but it is about the accumulation of things \"I know\".\n\nLeading this back, I never liked talking about specifics unless it pertains to my photography (well, not going to start now either). Things are moving along and \"evolving\" as it moves along. As it is highly dependent on the subjects that I choose to shoot with, the process and outcomes become disparate. Which is both intended and at the same time posing a problem, a rather big one, with coherence and consistency.\n\nSince I intend to create a zine, it is dawning upon me that it might not just be one. There is a consistent theme throughout but at the same time the unique quirks to each might just not make it possible to make one (with some semblance of consistency or a theme). Once I start churning out the images and laying them out then I should be able to see how I can arrange them. Sequencing might be the trickiest part yet.\n\nThere are some months left to consolidate before the end of the project, and I would have to do that soon. There are a few more subjects to be shot however I do not know if I should get more or not.

Knowing how to account for them, how to manage them, how to get rid of them entirely (almost).

Grasping, floating around like flotsam and jetsam of a wrecked ship stripped layer by layer.\n\nIt has afforded me a rather costly perspective, I have yet to process all of it, and will probably take quite a bit of time to ruminate each moment that has so easily slipped my hands. The aspect of how unprepared I was, a kind of blitzkrieg of situations that left me in a state of discombobulation. \n\nWhat I do know is that it was (or still is) real, and that in many ways have veered me away from the path that I have set myself on, in terms of the mentality and physicality. I have thought about how easy for humans to forget and have been in that state sporadically, but such was the fury of which my mind has chosen to perceive that I am not immune as much as I like to think that I am. \n\nAs intensely negative as all that sounds, it is quite the opposite. Such an event would not have occurred would it not for the adaptive changes that I have made over the years to the core self. That is not to say that the entirety of which had been a markedly positive experience. There are aspects of bitterness and regret - only so due to the fleeting nature of these moments in time. The desperation, and I would say onslaught of emotions against the usual stability of my compartmentalised mind. \n\nI do not know if this would pass, it seems to be something with more permanence - a state of a new normal would have to be attained in the foreseeable future. I am not sure hope should be in the equation. But I suppose as I have alluded to in the beginning, it is just the perceived sense of control. \n\nErraticism is not all bad.","src/content/muses/2019-09-06-verganglich.mdx","59a36a3eee0ef8e2","sisyphean",{"id":455,"data":457,"body":467,"filePath":468,"digest":469,"deferredRender":23},{"title":458,"tags":459,"author":16,"description":460,"image":461,"pubDate":465,"updatedDate":466},"Sisyphean",[9],"It started with an idea or rather an intention to create something but certain things never come to light.

Or rather in our attempt to keep it in the shadows, it would still be inadvertently found. I guess if and when this does go out, that would probably be an ironic statement to start off with.\n\n---\n\nWhat has transpired since the last time I was here? A lot has and at the same time, nothing much has. Time seemed to have stopped for a while, it is  feeling that I do not enjoy. The *quality* vs. *quantity* argument, in that sense *a lot* has happened, I suppose.\n\nThere has been some changes, which brings us here to a state of introspection. I must say the language is not as well thought out, and poetic as they were before. I really have fallen off it for a while now, I just have to write more of these.\n\nWhat inspired me to write again? I suppose this draft has been nagging at me, a little thorn in my side. And each time I would start something I would just as swiftly wipe the slate clean. Starting over, again and again. Each time I would write something with minor differences, iterations upon iterations.\n\nWould this time make a difference? I think not, it would however be a mish-mash of past ideas and past dreams. So even in a state of apparent completion it would just be an aggregation of incomplete attempts. Perhaps it would survive deletion this time. Or just remain in limbo.\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, much of the time *has* been in limbo, in a way you can reference the allegory of the cave, just as you are watching life pass you by. Every attempt to gain control is akin to grasping at your reflection on the water's surface - only momentarily interrupting with refractions, a rather rebellious attempt at gaining control only to resume that state normalcy that you find oh so abhorrent, yet again.\n\nSo then why continue at this seemingly frenetic pace or at times, time itself seems to stand still, days melding into days and you wonder about the progress you have sought out for yourself. Was the *goal* ever a reality? Or was the pursuit all is there to it?\n\nPerhaps *that* is all there is to it. Too big the scale of thought, or too minute makes the entirety of it pointless to ponder or discuss. The apparent lack of basis in reality creates a vacuum of self-indulgence. Why is that so bad, you might ask? Everyone has a different reality, or rather differing perceptions of  which they construe as a reality that they are living. \n\nI guess I would draw upon the concept of archetypes as opposed to stereotypes, and that of shared narratives. What we perceive as reality becomes wholly irrelevant when we take into consideration the most objective aspects of the act of living, that is, the interaction with the environment. \n\n---\n\nTaking that makes things a little bit clearer. As to why, I or probably any person who tries to exert control would end up in a relatively similar spot they were in before. The combination of time, place and probably a myriad other reasons intertwining creates the causality. But that in itself is ironic, and often those aspects of the environment are caused by other than itself, and you can go further back still.\n\nMaybe we should reconcile with the fact that we are all living in our own personal hamster wheels, *in perpetuum*.","src/content/muses/2020-12-23-sisyphean.mdx","653ca6320cc72c3c","pareidolia",{"id":470,"data":472,"body":481,"filePath":482,"digest":483,"deferredRender":23},{"title":473,"tags":474,"author":16,"description":475,"image":476,"pubDate":479,"updatedDate":480},"Pareidolia",[9],"There is no inherent underlying meaning in things we see and touch everyday.

It could also be books, the music you listen to or even white noise or artefacts in a particular recording of a particular song. Perhaps I am stretching the definition somewhat but we do tend to seek patterns or meaning in things that may or may not actually exhibit anything \"meaningful\" about them (depends on what you deem as meaningful, i.e. the philosophies, religions you subscribe to).\n\nI think this is a good thing.\n\nDoing anything for its own sake, in my opinion, makes for the most genuine form of purpose you can give yourself. You can think of: &ldquo;Why do anything, if not for fun?&rdquo;. It does not take away the merits of such an endeavour that you choose to take on (whatever those merits that you have applied to it) but instead enhances it. For there is no external factor but itself. This is, dare I say, pure.\n\nIt is classically human to look for meaning - a higher purpose if you will. There are a lot of unknowns and we want to make sense of it. You can say that it is fear at the most basic level. I do not think that either approach is necessarily superior to the other.

That being said would I be fine with selling my body in a more direct way than I already do now? Probably not (because of the aforementioned reasons). Though I would be hypocritical to think that the extent of the energy expenditure for remuneration is not dissimilar. Oftentimes, I would think to myself; who am I doing this for, and for what?\n\nWhen there's a need, there will be someone or something that comes along to fill that gap. I plug that gap in the way that I do, with flex tape. Others do it in their own way, and each person (although at the end, outcomes are pretty much indistinguishable) take different paths, and each path may take varying amounts of time to finish. Does finishing the work faster equate to better remuneration? And if you're paid the same anyway (same role), why work harder? For the potential of a promotion perhaps, or respect from your colleagues. Motivations differ.\n\nBut I digress. \n\nI started thinking about this more lately. The sense of identity one would have when they have a job. You are spending at least $\\frac{1}{3}$ of your adult working life doing just that. It has to have some meaning, a greater purpose if you will, in some sense, right? Why else would certain professions demand more \"respect\" than others? There is the money, and money can bring prestige, and then there's just the prestige, which could also bring other benefits, by way of reputation, which could then lead back to more money.\n\nI suppose this train of thought does dwell in the anarchist chasm, depending on what you subscribe to philosophically, there are _positive_ ways to look at this, just that I think sometimes it's a little bit too much _copium_ that we are pumping directly into our arteries, about the agency that we think we have.","src/content/muses/2025-05-24-fleece.mdx","3a1b87c0f99d2733","short_form",["Map",502,503,519,520,533,534,547,548],"hypnagogia",{"id":502,"data":504,"body":516,"filePath":517,"digest":518,"deferredRender":23},{"title":505,"tags":506,"author":16,"description":508,"image":509,"pubDate":514,"updatedDate":515},"Hypnagogia",[507],"short form","The perception of time has changed for me, rather drastically in fact.
